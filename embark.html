      <p class="workSubTitle">About</p>
      <p class="workBlurb">Embark! hosted on Heroku, is a tool geared towards career-changers who don’t know where to start.<br><br>For my final project at The Iron Yard, myself and another designer on the front-end along with a developer on the backend, decided to build a solution to address the challenging problems and opportunities we faced as career changers. Having just gone through this difficult and complicated process ourselves, our goal was to make this transition easier and more approachable. <br><br>We had two and a half weeks to take this project from research and discovery to the final live, coded version. We worked in an Agile environment, conducted daily stand ups and used Trello for project management - task breakdown, blockers and daily progress. We kept the focus on the user's needs and behaviors and spent the first five days on user/design research and interviewed four career changers. We analyzed our data and findings, crafted personas and identified three main problem areas to address. We then proceeded with sketches and wireframes and validated its usability through peer review. Once validated we continued with branding, prototyping, coding and integration with the backend. We spent the final week ironing out integration issues and focusing on functionality and user testing. Through research, feedback and design iterations we were able to create a solution that not only met our user’s needs, but also anticipated opportunities to make the user experience more useful and efficient.
        <!-- This is the final project I'm working on for The Iron Yard. I have two weeks to take this project from research and discovery to the final live, coded version. This project involves the design and development of the UI / UX and integration with backend. This is a group project, with two of us on the front end and a Python developer for the backend. -->
