      <p class="aboutBoxText">Hi! I'm a UI / UX Developer and Designer. I design and create digital experiences that are simple, beautiful and enjoyable.<br><br>After graduating from North Carolina State University with  a Masters in Computer Engineering I went on to work in the Networking Industry, Cisco Systems, as a Software Developer for the next decade. However, design and colors were always a passion of mine so I decided to combine the two and move into the exciting field of web design.<br><br>I believe in the power of simplicity and design, and in rethinking the user experience process i deliver creative, innovative and engaging solutions to every problem.<br><br>I begin a project by understanding the requirements. The brandâ€™s personality, tone of voice, objectives, target audience and competitors are all evaluated to ensure a point of difference is created. I strive to create outstanding work that is distinctive, engaging and above all, memorable.<br><br>With a variety of experience, ranging from software development in the networking industry to web development to design, color, typography, layout, I bring a multitude of skills to every problem I solve. So whether a project requires a logo, a range of packaging, animations, redesign, a website (or all of the above), I ensure that the whole experience is positive, consistent and effective.<br><br>If you have a potential project that I may be able to help you with, please get in touch. </p>
