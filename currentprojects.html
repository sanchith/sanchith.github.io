          <p>This project was born to address the challenges we faced with lost pets and trying to locate and return them to their owners. We realized quickly that although apps like Nextdoor existed, there wasn't anything out there that focused on pets and helped make this process easy.<br><br>This project is the UI/UX design and  development for the app. It's a group project with myself and another UI/UX designer working on design and front end and a developer for the back end.</p>

        <p>The Triangle UXPA was founded in 2006 and is the Triangle chapter of the User Experience Professionals Association. TriUXPA is focused on building and supporting the local community of practitioners who focus on crafting great user experiences.<br><br>As a member of TriUXPA I noticed that although their website contained all the information it was not structured well, was cluttered and it did not have a good user experience. So this project is a redesign and code prototype of the TriUXPA website with myself and another UI/UX designer working on design and development.</p>
